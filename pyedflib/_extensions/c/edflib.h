/**
 * @file edflib.h
 *
 * In EDF, the resolution (or sensitivity) (e.g. uV/bit) and offset are stored using four parameters:<br>
 * digital maximum and minimum, and physical maximum and minimum.<br>
 * Here, digital means the raw data coming from a sensor or ADC. Physical means the units like uV.<br>
 * The resolution in units per least significant bit is calculated as follows:<br>
 *
 * units per bit = (physical max - physical min) / (digital max - digital min)<br>
 *
 * The digital offset is calculated as follows:<br>
 *
 * offset = (physical max / units per bit) - digital max<br>
 *
 * For a better explanation about the relation between digital data and physical data,<br>
 * read the document "Coding Schemes Used with Data Converters" (PDF):<br>
 *
 * https://www.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?baseLiteratureNumber=sbaa042<br>
 *
 * An EDF file usually contains multiple so-called datarecords. One datarecord usually has a duration of one second (this is the default but it's not mandatory).<br>
 * In that case a file with a duration of five minutes contains 300 datarecords. The duration of a datarecord can be freely chosen but, if possible, use values from<br>
 * 0.1 to 1 second for easier handling. Just make sure that the total size of one datarecord, expressed in bytes, does not exceed 10 MByte (15 MBytes for BDF(+)).<br>
 *
 * The <b>recommendation</b> of a maximum datarecord size of 61440 bytes in the EDF(+) specification was useful in the time people were still using DOS as their main operating system.<br>
 * Using DOS and fast (near) pointers (16-bit pointers), the maximum allocatable block of memory was 64KByte.<br>
 * This is not a concern anymore so the maximum datarecord size now is limited to 10 MByte for EDF(+) and 15 MByte for BDF(+). This helps to accommodate for higher sampling rates<br>
 * used by modern Analog to Digital Converters.<br>
 *
 * EDF header character encoding: The EDF specification says that only (printable) ASCII characters are allowed.<br>
 * When writing the header info, EDFlib will assume you are using Latin1 encoding and it will automatically convert<br>
 * characters with accents, umlauts, tilde, etc. to their "normal" equivalent without the accent/umlaut/tilde/etc.<br>
 * in order to create a valid EDF file.<br>
 * The description of an EDF+ annotation/event/trigger on the other hand, is always encoded in UTF-8 (which is forward compatible with ASCII).<br>
 *
 * The sample frequency of a signal is calculated as follows: sf = (smp_in_datarecord * EDFLIB_TIME_DIMENSION) / datarecord_duration<br>
 *
 * Annotation signals<br>
 * ==================<br>
 *
 * EDF+ and BDF+ store the annotations/events/triggers in one or more signals (in order to be backwards compatible with EDF and BDF)<br>
 * and they can appear anywhere in the list of signals.<br>
 * The numbering of the signals in the file is zero based (starts at 0). Signals used for annotations are skipped by EDFlib.<br>
 * This means that the annotationsignal(s) in the file are hidden.<br>
 * Use the function edf_get_annotation() to get the annotations.<br>
 *
 * So, when a file contains 7 signals and the third and fifth signal are annotation signals, the library will<br>
 * report that there are only 5 signals in the file.<br>
 * The library will "map" the (zero-based) signal numbers as follows: 0->0, 1->1, 2->3, 3->4, 4->6.<br>
 * This way you don't need to worry about which signals are annotationsignals, the library will take care of it.<br>
 *
 * How the library stores time values<br>
 * ==================================<br>
 *
 * To avoid rounding errors and to be able to compare values, the library stores some time values in variables of type long long int.<br>
 * In order not to lose the sub-second precision, all time values are scaled with a scaling factor: 10000000.<br>
 * This will limit the time resolution to 100 nanoseconds. To calculate the amount of seconds, divide<br>
 * the timevalue by 10000000 or use the macro EDFLIB_TIME_DIMENSION which is declared in edflib.h.<br>
 * The following variables use this scaling when you open a file in read mode: "file_duration", "starttime_subsecond" and "onset".<br>
 *
 * EDFlib and thread-safety<br>
 * ========================<br>
 * The following functions are always MT-unsafe:<br>
 * edfopen_file_readonly()   (race condition)<br>
 * edfclose_file()           (race condition)<br>
 * edflib_get_handle()       (race condition)<br>
 *
 * When writing to or reading from the same file, all EDFlib functions are MT-unsafe (race condition).<br>
 *
 * When accessing EDFlib from different threads, use a mutex.<br>
 *
 * For more info about the EDF and EDF+ format, visit: https://edfplus.info/specs/<br>
 *
 * For more info about the BDF and BDF+ format, visit: https://www.teuniz.net/edfbrowser/bdfplus%20format%20description.html<br>
