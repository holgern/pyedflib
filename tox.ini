# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# Running the command 'tox' while in the root of the pyedflib source
# directory will:
#   - Create a pyedflib source distribution (setup.py sdist)
#   - Then for every supported version of Python:
#     - Create a virtualenv in {homedir}/.tox/pyedflib/py$VERSION and
#       install dependencies. (These virtualenvs are cached across
#       runs unless you use --recreate.)
#     - Use pip to install the pyedflib sdist into the virtualenv
#     - Run the pyedflib tests
# To run against a specific subset of Python versions, use:
#   tox -e py26,py27

# Tox assumes that you have appropriate Python interpreters already
# installed and that they can be run as 'python2.6', 'python2.7', etc.
